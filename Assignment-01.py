# Assign x='Hello World' 

x = 'Hello World'
# print(x) within your script.
print(x)
# Identify the variable type of x and print type of variable
print(type(x))

# Using string concatenation to modify the "Hello World', by implementing y=x+'1'.
y = x + '1'
# Existing Object x modified to become 'Hello Wolrd1'
print(y)

The above example explains few charateristics of strings in python

1. strings are characters, declared in single(') or double(" ") quotes.
2. Value of a string variable remains unchanged, even though we create a new variable with help of it 
   unless we assign a new value to it. 
3. Type of a string variable in python is mentioned as <class 'str'>.

'''

print(id(x))
print(id(y))

'''

For the statement "does x reference the same Object before and after",
The memory IDs of x and y differ because, while y was initialized using x, 
Python created a new object for y. Hence, the original object referenced by x remains unaffected.‚Äù
